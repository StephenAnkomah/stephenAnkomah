## Simple-SOHO-Network-Simulation-On-CISCO-Packet-Tracer
This is a network security project where Cisco packet tracer was used to simulate a small network environment and how to protect it..

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases a basic but functional network topology that supports wired and wireless connectivity, internet access, and fundamental security controls.

The goal is to provide a hands-on learning environment for understanding how real-world small business networks are planned, configured, and secured.
